       Indexes in SQL Server
1.To Provide The quick retrival of data from the database We use sql Index in 
  in the database
2.It is use for find specific data from the without scanning full Table scan 
3.Index are created on Table and viewl
4.Index are just like that front Page of the book
5.If I write the Index in the Table so I do not need not check every Row And it 
will increase the performace of the queries  

Select * from fullTimeEmployee 
where Salary>1000 and Salary<22000
 Now Im using Index
Create index Ix_FTE_SALARY ON FULLTIMEEMPLOYEE(
SALARY ASC)
SP_HELPINDEX TABLENAME// FOR This we can get index name which collum He has 
applied
//FOR DROP THE TABLE WE WRITE THIS SYNTEX 
DROP INDEX TABLENAME .INDEXINAME 

CREATE INDEX IN WHICH COLLUM WHIC HAVE FREQUNTALLY USED
AS LIKE ID,SALARY
Note 
1.We use index where i am using select with where clause 
2.we do not create index on that table who use insert update and delete command
(SO IT IS GOOD PRACTICE THAT CREATE THAT TABLE INDEX WHOSE NOT USING FREQENTLY 
DML OPERATION)
3.INDEX ARE AUTOMATICALLY CREATED WHEN I CREATE AS A PRIMARY KEY AND UNIQUE KEY

SINGLE COLUMN INDEX
IMPLICIT INDEX 

WHERE I DO NOT USE INDEXES
1.FOR SMALL TABLE 
2.FOR DML OPERATON
3.I DO NOT USE FOR THAT COLUMN WHERE HAVE HIGH NUMBER OF THE NULL

CLUSTERD INDEX
1.FOR ANY TABLE HAVE ONLY ONE CLUSTERD INDEX 
2.WHEN I USE THIS INDEX THEN SORTING TAKING PLACE IN MAIN TABLE NOT STORED 
IN THE EXTRA PLACE 
3.WE CAN HAVE ONLY ONE CLUSTERED INDEX WITH MULTIPAL COLUMN THIS IS COLLED 
AS COMPOSITE INDEX
CERATE CLUSTERD INDEX  IX_FTE_GENDER_SALARY_CLUSTERED ON
FULLTimeEmployee (GENDER(ASC),SALARY (DESC)) //THIS IS COMPOSITE INDEX

NON CLUSTERD INDEX 
1.IN A TABLE THERE ARE MULTIPAL NON CLUSTER INDEX IN A TABLE 
2.NON CLUSTERD INDEX HAVE DIFFERENT LOCATION FOR THE STOREAGE 
3.NON CLUSTERD INDEX IS SLOWER THEN CLUSTERD INDEX 
4.IN THIS INDEX THERE THERE IS NO DATA LOSS WHEN I DROP THE TABLE 
SYNTEX
CREATE NONCLUSTERD INDEX INDEX NAME ON TABLENAME (COLUMNNAME)
HOW TO CREATE THE COMPOSITE NONCLUSTERD INDEX
CREATE NONCLUSTERD INDEX INDEXName TableName(columnname1,columnname2)
